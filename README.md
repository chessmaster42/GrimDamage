# GrimDamage
Grim Dawn Damage Meter

Lets the user monitor how much damage he deals, and receives.
Its core functionality lies in the player being able to tell exactly what killed him, and comparing "hard-to-compare" builds.

The project has been revived and will hopefully be updated from time to time.
